This started out as a failed PyWeek 19 entry. We totally bit off a bit to much for that contest, however we have decided to just continue working on the framework side of it to use in future projects for PyWeek or other things.

PyWeek 19 entry Theme: One Room
This game is a 2d platformer. Its written with python, and pysdl2.
We created our own opengl binding for pyweek, because we were having issues with PyOpenGL that we didn't have time to figure out.
The opengl binding is located in cubix/core/opengl/ if you want to try and extend it any.
